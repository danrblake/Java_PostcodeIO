# Java_PostcodeIO

## Project Aim
This project was created in order to introduce API calls using HTTP Client and parse that information into a readable format that currently
can be sent via console. Alongside this tests were written in order to ensure the validity of the data. 

## How to use

In order to use/test this project you will need to use the PostcodeInfoParser object as this has the responsibility of making the HTTP call and storing the overall data. From there you can access the specific fields listed on the API docs ([found here](https://postcodes.io/))
